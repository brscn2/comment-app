# comment-app
A comment-app coded using NodeJS, Express, MongoDB, Bootstrap for practicing backend development,building a REST API and routing.

The API satisfies basic CRUD operations and is built using Express for different views.

    GET /comments - list all comments
    POST /comments - create a new comment
    GET /comments/:id - get particular comment using id
    PATCH /comments/:id - update particular comment
    DELETE /comments/:id - delete particular comment

Each comment has an unique ID generated via uuidv4 and is stored in a No-SQL database using MongoDB.

I am still working on this app. Some features currently on my to-do list are:
    - User authentication
    - Comment liking
    - Sorting of comments by different categories
    - Improvements to the front-end
    ...
    
This app is for me to practice what I have learned in the field of web development.
